We know that Java Program runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When we compile a Java Class, 
it transforms it in the form of bytecode that is platform and machine independent compiled program 
and store it as a .class file. After that when we try to use a Class, Java ClassLoader loads that class into memory.
