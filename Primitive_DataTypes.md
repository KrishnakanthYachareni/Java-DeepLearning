## Primitive Data types in Java
There are mainly two types of programming languages are present.
1. **Dynamically Typed:** These languages where each variable & expression type is no need to known at compile time. 
This means these languages can receive different data types over the time.<br />
```Example: Ruby, Python```
2. **Statically Typed"** These are where each variable is declared to be certain data type before compilation of a class.<br />
```Example: Java, C, C++``` <br />
So Java is Statically typed language, that means every variable & expression should declared to be certain data type we before we use in a class.
Java has two catagories of data types
- **Primitive Data types** (ex: Integer, character...etc)
- **Referenced or Object Data types** (ex: Strings, Arrays, Class Objects, User defined types) <br />
let us know about Primitive Data types now.
Primitive data are only single values; they have no special capabilities. There are 8 primitive data types in Java.
